<article aria-label="Stabat Mater &ndash; English translation" class="post-3140 page type-page status-publish entry boxed"><div class="entry-content"><p>As several versions of the Stabat Mater exist, these variations in the Latin text are given per line. These versions are probably the cause that on the most encountered translation by <a href="../stabat-mater-english-translation-by-edward-caswall-1849/index.html">Edward Caswall</a> some doctoring has been done and for some lines of the translation several completely different versions exist.</p>
<p>All these poems start with the line <i>At the cross her station keeping, stood the mournful mother weeping, close to Jesus to the last. </i>Per line you will find all translations that I found, the literal ones first, the rhyming ones in italics.</p>
<p>It is interesting to see how much they sometimes can differ, even though this may be caused by the different Latin versions. Even the literal translations are sometimes more poetical than correct!</p>
<p>The first line (or lines) is my own translation (underlined), revised by a teacher in Latin, Mrs Anita van Ommeren, which should be as close as possible to the original.</p>
<p>In his book <a href="../desmond-fisher-and-jacopone-da-todi/index.html">Stabat Mater, The Mystery Hymn</a>, Desmond Fisher presents and&nbsp;explains the two translations he made himself; a literal translation from the latin text, and a more <a href="../english-translation-by-desmond-fisher-2014/index.html">poetic interpretation in verse</a>. The original translation in English by <a href="../stabat-mater-english-translation-by-edward-caswall-1849/index.html">Edward Caswall</a> which I found in <a href="../desmond-fisher-and-jacopone-da-todi/index.html">Desmond Fishers</a> book is from 1849. <a href="../english-translation-by-beatrice-e-bullman/index.html">Beatrice E. Bulman</a> made a completely different rhyming version.</p>
